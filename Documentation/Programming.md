## Programming in Armstrong:
> The complete list of armstrong commands are at the bottom of this page.
1. Create a file, name it `main.armstrong`. It can also end with `.arm`.
2. The first line inside this file ***must*** be `#AS`. This is how the compiler knows what to do.
3. I recommend using VSCode, because I developed a syntax highlighting [extension here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sam-astro.armstrong).
4. Try out some of the example code in the `example_armstrong_programs` folder in this repo.
