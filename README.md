# Astro-8 Computer   [![Badge License]][License]

<br>

## Introduction
The Astro-8 is a 16-bit computer design. It has a working **[Logisim Evolution]** circuit, along with an emulator on Windows, Mac, and Linux, for running code at full speed. There is an assembly language, along with a higher level language called Armstrong, plus more which are actively being built by the community.

I created a video about the creation of this and how it works, which you can view here:

## Demos
There are some demos for the Astro-8, such as the pong game and a typing program. You can locate those in the folder `/example_armstrong_programs/`.

## Programming
The two most supported ways to program for the computer is using the [assembly language](https://sam-astro.github.io/Astro8-Computer/docs/Architecture/Instruction%20Set.html) or [Armstrong](https://sam-astro.github.io/Astro8-Computer/docs/Armstrong/README.html).
